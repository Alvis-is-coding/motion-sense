# MotionSense Dataset [Under Construction :construction_worker: :construction_worker:]
This dataset includes time-series data generated by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (attitude, gravity, userAcceleration, and rotationRate). It is collected with an iPhone 6s kept in the participant's front pocket using [SensingKit](https://www.sensingkit.org/) which collects information from [Coer Motion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmdevicemotion) framework on iOS devices. A total of 24 participants in a range of gender, age, weight and height performed 6 activities in 15 trials in the same environment and conditions: downstairs, upstairs, walking, jogging, siting, and standing. With this dataset, we aim to look for {\em personal attributes fingerprints} in time-series of sensor data, i.e.~attribute-specific patterns that can be used to infer gender or personality of the data subjects in addition to their activities.
