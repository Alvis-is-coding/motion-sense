# MotionSense Dataset [Under Construction :construction_worker: :construction_worker:]
This dataset includes time-series data generated by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (attitude, gravity, userAcceleration, and rotationRate). It is collected with an iPhone 6s kept in the participant's front pocket using [SensingKit](https://www.sensingkit.org/) which collects information from [Coer Motion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmdevicemotion) framework on iOS devices. A total of 24 participants in a range of gender, age, weight and height performed 6 activities in 15 trials in the same environment and conditions: downstairs, upstairs, walking, jogging, siting, and standing. With this dataset, we aim to look for {\em personal attributes fingerprints} in time-series of sensor data, i.e.~attribute-specific patterns that can be used to infer gender or personality of the data subjects in addition to their activities.

## Scenario
  For each participant, the study had been commenced by collecting their demographic (age and gender) and physically-related (height and weight) information. Then, we provided them with a dedicated smartphone (iPhone 6), and asked them to store it in their trousers' front pocket during the experiment. All the participant were asked to wear flat shoes. We then asked them to perform 6 different activities (walk downstairs, walk upstairs, sit, stand and jogging) around the Queen Mary University of London's Mile End campus. For each trial, the researcher set up the phone and gave it to the currrent participants, then the researcher stood in a corner. Then, the participant pressed the start button of [Crowdsense app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crowdsense/id930853606?mt=8) and put it in thier trousers' front pocket and performed the specified activity. We asked them to do it as natural as possible, like their everday life. At the end of each trial, they took the phone out of their pocket and pressed stop button. The exact places and routes for running all the activities is shown in the illustrative map in the following Figure.

As we can see, there are 15 trials:
1. Long trials: those with number 1 to 9 with around 2 to 3 minutes duration.
2. Short trials: those with number 11 to 16 that are around 30 seconds to 1 minutes duration.

## Data Subjects
There are 24 data subjects. Here we summarized their information:
